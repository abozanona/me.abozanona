**29 November 2024**
After more than 13 months of Israeli attacks on Gaza, at least 44,382 people have been killed. Over 105,000 have been wounded, and thousands more are still missing or under the rubble. Despite these horrifying numbers, countries like the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom continue to send weapons to Israel—helping them carry out more destruction in Gaza and more violence in the West Bank.

Western governments keep saying that "Israel has the right to defend itself." They repeat this over and over, even while entire families are being wiped out. They don't call for a stop to the violence. They just ask Israel to "be more careful" when killing innocent people.

This time, the victims were not Palestinians. They were foreign aid workers. And suddenly, the reactions changed. Western governments, who had stayed silent for months, started making loud statements:

* **United States**: President Joe Biden said he was “outraged and heartbroken.” He admitted that Israel had not done enough to protect civilians and aid workers. He even warned that future U.S. support could depend on how Israel responds.

* **United Kingdom, France, and Canada**: These countries made their strongest criticism of Israel so far. They called the situation in Gaza “disproportionate” and “intolerable.” They demanded a ceasefire, the full return of humanitarian aid, and even mentioned possible sanctions or recognizing the State of Palestine if Israel didn’t change course.

* **European Union**: The EU, along with 24 other donor countries, demanded an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Sweden, talked about reviewing trade deals and punishing Israeli leaders for war crimes.

It sounded serious. It sounded like things were about to change.

**But just a few months later...**
Nothing changed. Israel kept killing, the destruction in Gaza kept growing, and the same governments went back to supporting Israel—giving it money, weapons, and political cover.

**21 May 2025**
Israeli soldiers fired at a group of international diplomats visiting the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank [[source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/21/eu-arab-diplomats-come-under-israeli-fire-in-occupied-west-banks-jenin)]. These were not Palestinian civilians—they were officials from the EU, Arab countries, Asia, and the West.

* **France** called the shooting "unjustifiable and unacceptable."
* **Germany** strongly condemned the attack and said the visit had been coordinated with Israeli forces.
* **France, Italy, and Portugal** summoned Israeli ambassadors for explanations.

But let's be honest.
Just like before, these words won’t last.
These governments will soon move on and go back to business as usual with Israel—just like they always do.

### The Hypocrisy is Clear

When Palestinians are killed, Western governments largely remain silent. When others are harmed—especially foreigners—suddenly, there’s outrage, statements, and demands. This pattern is consistent. The response depends on who is affected, not what is happening. This shows a double standard in how governments apply international law and human rights. Despite repeated violations and ongoing violence, these same governments continue to support Israel politically and militarily. Public statements may shift temporarily when international personnel are harmed, but in practice, little changes.

At the same time, public opinion is shifting. People across many countries are paying closer attention, asking questions, and showing support for Palestinians. While governments may act based on politics and alliances, many individuals are pushing for a more consistent and fair approach. This growing awareness may not change government policies overnight—but it makes it harder for them to justify ongoing double standards.

So to the people—**thank you!** Your solidarity means everything.  
And to the governments—**shame on you!** Your double standards are clear, and history will remember.
