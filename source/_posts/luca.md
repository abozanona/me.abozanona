I’m happy to share the news with everyone that we’re currently working on the development of Luca; a chrome extension built on top of react to watching movies with friends 🎥. Using Luca, you can create parties 🎉, invite friends👬, sync movie player▶️, chat with friends💬, send reactions😂, and do many more things.

<!--more-->

Our goal with Luca is to allow friends to watch any online video with friends without the need to upload the video to any third party website or application 💃.

We're also planning to expand Luca to other platforms. Our goal is for everyone to run Luca on Chrome / Edge / Safari / Firefox / Android / IOS.

Luca is completely free and open source 👾. We welcome all kind of contributions to the chrome extension code and design. Drop Luca's repo a visit on GitHub https://github.com/abozanona/luca.

You can try the latest version of Luca from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obnoakbedffbolampagecgineggakiii). If you have an issue, bug or suggestions, don’t hesitate to open an issue with it on Github using [this link](https://github.com/abozanona/luca/issues) or sending us your feedback on our discord server.

We also have a discord channel! It's still new, and we want to build a big community there, so we welcome all of you to [join us there](https://discord.com/invite/T3uvQupA).

Luca was made with love thanks to [@abozanona](https://github.com/abozanona), [@Mahmoud-Skafi](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Skafi) & [@yousefra](https://github.com/yousefra).

Big thanks for [Co.Te.De Technologies](https://cotede.co/) for their support on the Luca extension.
