My brother studies English translations. He had an online quiz where he should memorize around 200 English words and their meaning in Arabic.

His teacher will tell him three words in Arabic and he should tell him the meaning in English. And then he will give him another three English words and my brother should give him the meaning in Arabic.

I wrote a python code with him to help him cheat in the quiz. :)
