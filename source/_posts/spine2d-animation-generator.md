For the past four months, I’ve been quietly working on a project I’m really excited to finally share: **Spine2D Animation Generator**.

This idea has been growing in my mind for a long time. I’ve always wanted to come up with a simple way to turn ideas into animated characters without spending days rigging, segmenting, and keyframing manually.

<!--more-->

So I started building exactly that. A UI-powered tool that allows anyone to generate **Spine2D-style animations using AI prompts.**

## 💡 What is Spine2D Animation Generator?

Imagine describing a character with words "clothing style, colors, vibe", and the system generates the character image for you.

Then you ask it to segment the character into parts. It does that too.

Tell it to add a skeleton & bone structure. It responds.

Ask it to animate "walk, jump, blink, dance". It animates.

All *with prompts*.

No drawing skills required. No complex rigging workflows.
Just **type → generate → animate**.

This is the vision.

## 🛠 Current Progress

The tool is still in development. I’ve been working on it only in my free time, so progress has been slow, but steady. The UI is coming together nicely, and many core features are already taking shape.

You can watch a short preview of what I have so far here 👇

I’ve also put up a temporary landing page for it: **[https://spine2d.com/](https://spine2d.com/)**

It’s a placeholder for now, but one day soon it will become the home of the full product.

If everything goes well, I hope to have a usable version sometime early next year.
