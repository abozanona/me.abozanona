A long time ago, I was having a conversation with my mother about my country Palestine. I told her that the situation would get worse. She said, "This is our life. It is our destiny to live this struggle and fight it. For that, we were born in this land. This is our test."

Her words came back to my mind many times this past year, especially during the demonstrations I participated in here in Hamburg, the war on Gaza, the destruction and the killing of innocent people.Â The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "How wonderful is the affair of the believer! Verily, all of his affairs are good, and this is not for anyone except the believer. If something good happens to him, he is grateful and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he is patient and that is good for him". This hadith reflects the resilience of the people of Gaza. No matter how much they suffer, they continue to stand firm, resist, and hold onto hope. Their strength in the face of such devastation is a lesson for the world.

Since the start of the war on Gaza, I have participated in many protests in Hamburg. People from different backgrounds, religions, and nationalities came together to stand for Palestine. We marched through the streets, holding Palestinian flags, chanting for justice, and demanding an end to the genocide in Gaza. I have recorded many moments from the protests I attended in Hamburg. Here is a playlist of those videos:

Despite the massive support for Palestine worldwide, German goverment, like many Western goverments, continues its blind support for Israel. The government justifies this with what they call "guilt complex/historical responsibility" Because of their history, they feel responsible for supporting Israel no matter what. But it makes no sense to support a genocide out of guilt. First, because today's Germans did not commit the crimes of the past. And second, because supporting a new injustice does not correct an old one.

I have met many German friends who disagree with their government's stance. They told me how this "historical responsibility" is taught in schools and from a young age. But things are changing. More and more people are questioning this narrative and standing up against all forms of injustice, including the genocide in Gaza.

I am not afraid of being killed by an Israeli soldier. I know that if I die, I will go to a better place. What bothers me the most is that after I die, they will reduce me to a number. A single number added to the total death toll. But I'm not just a number, and each one of us is more than a number. We are lives, dreams, hopes, families, stories, and memories.

What gives me strength is the solidarity from people all over the world. Seeing people in different countries protesting, raising awareness, and demanding justice gives me hope that Palestine will one day be free.

One moment that touched me deeply was a video I saw of Italian tourists singing "Bella Ciao" on Shuhada Street in Hebron. This street is the one I used to take to high school. It runs through the heart of Hebron, where Israeli settlers have occupied the city center. It is now closed to Palestinians except for those who live there, and even they must show identification to pass.

I have had many interactions with Israeli soldiers and settlers on that street. It is a place filled with tension and injustice. But seeing people from across the world stand there and sing a song of resistance gave me hope. It showed that more people are becoming aware of the Palestinian struggle.

Much of what we know about the war on Gaza comes from brave journalists risking their lives to report the truth. Many of us around the world have followed them on Instagram, relying on their updates to understand what is happening on the ground. Here are some of the journalists whose work has made a difference: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wael_eldahdouh/" target="__blank">@wael_eldahdouh</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anasjamal44/" target="__blank">@anasjamal44</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anas.jamal33/" target="__blank">@anas.jamal33</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hossam_shbat/" target="__blank">@hossam_shbat</a>

The struggle continues, and so does our resistance. One day, Palestine will be free.
