I worked on developing flutter Android and IOS applications for fetching and displaying videos from streaming websites through REST API <!--more-->

I used the Bloc State Management Library in the application development.

There's no direct way to fetch Video streams from free video streaming websites, so I used multiple packages to parse pages HTML tags and execute JS scripts to be able to get video stream links.

The application does the following.

 - View videos from streaming websites.
 - Search videos by name and category.
 - Create playlists for videos.
 - Create a new account on the application. Add videoes to persomal lists.
 - View video author profiles.
 - Search for similar videos.
